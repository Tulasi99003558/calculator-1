# **Define your Product: Calculator**

1. Elementary school/ Junior high-school student:

**Purpose of use** : Checking the PI rational and mathematics and studies like algebra

Design: Designing of product based on the level of usage, As per the standards, students are very simple calculations so designing of the product is very attractive and easy to operate.

1. High School/ Secondary Education:

**Purpose of use** : Calculating the matrix values and Trigonometric values and equations

Design: As the level of usage increase the calculator should have same changes that can solve the equations and moderate calculations and precision values.

So, designing should be moderate and scientific keys must be introduced.

1. University/ under Graduation student:

**Purpose of use** : Calculating the Probability functions, run time Complexity, Aptitude Calculations, To avoid scientific notation so numbers look big,Validating float calculations with high-level precision.

Design: When the calculator is in the hands of undergraduate student, the usage is very high level. It should be compatible. Along with the Scientific keys introducing of programming run time calculations, Eigen values etc.â€¦ AS the Design is Complex, but the usage and outfit of the calculator must be clear and easy to operate

1. Engineers:

**Purpose of use** : Calculating the eigen values for the Location of balance,

Probability functions, Calculations of estimated cost, ages etc.

Design: Using the standard methods and following the high precision for designing the calculator and all the operations are very convenient for the user and having more no of functions built in it.

## SWOT ANALYSIS:

![](RackMultipart20210206-4-8ltef0_html_b1f9957005242ef8.jpg)
SWOT stands for Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats, and so a SWOT Analysis is a technique for assessing these four aspects of your business.

You can use SWOT Analysis to make the most of what you've got, to your organization's best advantage. And you can reduce the chances of failure, by understanding what you're lacking, and eliminating hazards that would otherwise catch you unawares.

Better still, you can start to craft a strategy that distinguishes you from your competitors, and so compete successfully in your market.
